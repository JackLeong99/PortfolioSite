            Dear Llewyn Salt, <br><br>

            As an aspiring junior developer I'm excited to apply for the software engineering positions you have available, both frontend and full stack. Aside from my university degree in software development I come from a background in IT and freelance web dev. Now, I'm excited to take the next step by joining a team of professional developers where I can contribute, learn, and grow. <br><br>

            I have plenty of experience in frontend from my time at university, my freelancing work, and my own personal projects. I also have experience in backend both from academic coursework and self directed experimentation with JavaScript libraries like React and Three.js. <br><br>

            My current freelance work has involved helping clients with existing websites, as well as creating an entirely new web presences for them using WordPress and remote hosting solutions. Before freelancing I worked as a support specialist for Central Telecoms, an IP phone and NBN provider for businesses along the Central coast up to Newcastle. I worked to not just resolve customer issues but also learn about the inner workings of the Bicom PBX instances we hosted on AWS, the nature of the NBN services we provided, and computer networking as a whole. <br><br>

            What excites me about this opportunity at Murray Irrigation is that it's a chance to contribute to infrastructure that has a real impact, supporting Australian farmers and communities. It's interesting and meaningful work, where I would also have an opportunity to grow my own skills in a collaborative environment alongside likeminded developers. While I may be beginning my career in software I bring a strong work ethic, fast learning ability, and a real enthusiasm to give value to the team. <br><br>

            Thanks for taking the time to read my application, I'd love the chance to grow with you and in turn contribute to your mission. I'm available for interviews or further talks at any time, so please don't hesitate to shoot me an email at jackleong875@gmail.com or call me on my mobile. <br><br>

            Kind regards, <br><br>

            <i>Jack K Leong</i>
