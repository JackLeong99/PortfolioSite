            Dear Neuska team, <br><br>
            I'm a graduate of Macquarie University with a Bachelor of IT, majoring in software development. Software development is my passion, and your position is of great interest to me as I see it as an opportunity to contribute to your company, learn, and develop my expertise.<br><br>
            I am experienced with JavaScript, have some knowledge of MySQL and MongoDB, and solid experience in TCP/IP networking strengthened through my previous role at Central Telecoms Gosford. I also have some experience with Unix environments like Ubuntu and MacOS. I am currently working directly with business clients to create their websites, which has given me experience in delivering projects in a timely manner while employing excellent communication. These skills and a natural affinity for problem solving allow me to explore the limits of what's possible.<br><br>
            My own interests and my previous role have allowed me to gain knowledge in network routing, port forwarding and to a lesser degree firewalls. I am also experienced with UI/UX design, VSCode, and multiple programming languages, including scripting languages such as Python and C#, as well as object-oriented ones such as Java.<br><br>
            My lifelong interest in software development along with my values and work ethics allow me to thrive in a fast-paced, team environment. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity of an interview for the full time role in your Gosford offices, and look forward to hearing from you with great enthusiasm.
        </p>
