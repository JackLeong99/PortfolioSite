            Dear ASIC Hiring Team,<br><br>

            I'm excited to fill the Junior Test Automation Engineer role at ASIC, where I can combine my technical foundation in software development with my belief in protecting consumers and ensuring financial system integrity. As a recent IT graduate majoring in Software Development, I’ve built expertise in Java, C#, and agile methodologies, skills I’m eager to leverage in supporting ASIC’s mission.
            <br><br>
            Although I'm still early on in my career, my academic experience and self-driven learning have set me up with the skills for success, as well as relevant technical skills: I'm proficient working with Java and C# using object-oriented principles, comfortable with MySQL, and while I haven't used Azure DevOps, I frequently use version control for my own projects and understand what DevOps offers in terms of CI/CD pipelines and project management. Lastly while I don't have experience in Selenium, I'm confident that I would be able to pick it up relatively quickly and have already begun learning about it while writing this.
            <br><br>
            What really draws me to this role is the chance to work in an industry that I've aspired to be a part of since I was young, working for a cause I genuinely believe in. I'm a fast learner with a love for problem solving, and extensive experience both collaborating within a team and coordinating between multiple teams, all of which are traits that I believe would allow me to make a meaningful contribution to the securities & investments commission.
            <br><br>
            I'd love the opportunity to discuss how my technical foundation and problem-solving mindset could translate into this role and help me contribute meaningful value to the team. Thank you for your consideration and taking the time to read this, I look forward to the possibility of being a part of ASIC’s work.        </p>
